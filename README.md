# killPRML
---------------------------
## Introduction
Why I open this repo is that I found in my research, I found myself not very familar with some ML algorithms, so I decide to go thorogh PRML to have a review. 

---------------------------
## Structure
There are 3 parts of this repo. First part is the answer for each chapter, I will try to not skip any steps in derivation. Second part Pytho implementation for some ML models, I will try to give some visualization to help deeper understanding the models to have a better intution. Third part is just C++ implementation I am planning to do if I have time.
